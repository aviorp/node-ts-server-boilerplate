# Node TS Server Boilerplate

The project is a Skeleton application built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It allows users to develop and manage API Quickly. The project uses a class-based approach to structure the code, making it easier to maintain and extend.

The project includes the following components:

## API Configuration

The API configuration files in the project are written in TypeScript. TypeScript provides static typing, which makes it easier to catch errors during development and improve code quality. The API configurations include settings for integrating with third-party services such as Amazon S3.

## Database Interactions

The project uses Prisma as the ORM to interact with the database. Prisma is a type-safe database client that generates TypeScript types for the database schema, making it easier to work with the database in a type-safe manner. Prisma also provides query builders that make it easier to write complex database queries in a safe and efficient way.

## Error Handling

The project includes custom error handling middleware that is written in TypeScript. The error handling middleware provides consistent error responses in a standard format for client-side consumption. Using TypeScript for error handling provides a type-safe way to catch and handle errors in the application.

## Interfaces

The project includes interfaces that are written in TypeScript. The interfaces provide a clear definition of data types and structures used within the application. Using TypeScript interfaces helps to ensure that the data passed around the application is correctly typed and prevents runtime errors.

## Middlewares

The middleware functions in the project are written in TypeScript. The middleware functions provide various functionalities such as authentication, authorization, logging, rate limiting, and more. Using TypeScript for middleware functions provides a type-safe way to work with the request and response objects.

## Routes

The route configuration files in the project are written in TypeScript. The route configuration files define the API endpoints and their associated middleware and handlers. Using TypeScript for route configuration files provides a type-safe way to work with the request and response objects.

## Services

The service classes in the project are written in TypeScript and are class-based. The service classes provide the business logic for each resource. Using TypeScript for service classes provides a type-safe way to work with the data passed to and returned from the services.

## Utilities

The utility functions in the project are written in TypeScript. The utility functions provide commonly used functionalities such as encryption, validation, formatting, and more. Using TypeScript for utility functions provides a type-safe way to work with the data passed to and returned from the utility functions.

## Authentication

The project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The authentication logic is written in TypeScript and is class-based. Users can authenticate by sending their credentials in a request to the server, and if the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client. The client then includes the JWT token in subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize access to protected resources.

## CI/CD

The project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs tests, linters, and code coverage checks on each push to the main branch. If the checks pass, the pipeline deploys the application to a staging environment. If the staging environment tests pass, the pipeline deploys the application to the production environment. The CI/CD pipeline is written in YAML and is version controlled along with the rest of the project code.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project is built with TypeScript and is class-based. It uses Prisma as the ORM to interact with the database and includes custom error handling middleware and authentication logic. The project includes various APIs, configuration files, interfaces, middleware, route configuration files, services, and utility functions. The project also includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Using TypeScript in the project provides a type-safe way to catch errors during development, which leads to higher code quality. Prisma provides a type-safe database client and query builder, making it easier to write complex database queries in a safe and efficient way. The custom error handling middleware and authentication logic provide consistent error responses and a secure way to authenticate and authorize users.

The project is structured in a modular way, with each component separated into its own file or directory. This makes it easier to maintain and modify the project as it grows. The use of a CI/CD pipeline helps to ensure that the project is consistently tested and deployed in a controlled and automated manner.
