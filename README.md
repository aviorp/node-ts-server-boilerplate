## API Configuration	## API Configuration
The API configuration files in the project are written in TypeScript. TypeScript provides static typing, which makes it easier to catch errors during development and improve code quality. The API configurations include settings for integrating with third-party services such as Amazon S3.	The API configuration files in the project are written in TypeScript.

## Database Interactions	## Database Interactions
The project uses Prisma as the ORM to interact with the database. Prisma is a type-safe database client that generates TypeScript types for the database schema, making it easier to work with the database in a type-safe manner. Prisma also provides query builders that make it easier to write complex database queries in a safe and efficient way.	The project uses Prisma as the ORM to interact with the database.

## Error Handling	## Error Handling
The project includes custom error handling middleware that is written in TypeScript. The error handling middleware provides consistent error responses in a standard format for client-side consumption. Using TypeScript for error handling provides a type-safe way to catch and handle errors in the application.	The project includes custom error handling middleware that is written in TypeScript.

## Interfaces	## Interfaces
The project includes interfaces that are written in TypeScript. The interfaces provide a clear definition of data types and structures used within the application. Using TypeScript interfaces helps to ensure that the data passed around the application is correctly typed and prevents runtime errors.	The project includes interfaces that are written in TypeScript.

## Authentication	## Authentication
The project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The authentication logic is written in TypeScript and is class-based. Users can authenticate by sending their credentials in a request to the server, and if the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client. The client then includes the JWT token in subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize access to protected resources.	The project uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## CI/CD	## CI/CD
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs tests, linters, and code coverage checks on each push to the main branch. If the checks pass, the pipeline deploys the application to a staging environment. If the staging environment tests pass, the pipeline deploys the application to the production environment. The CI/CD pipeline is written in YAML and is version controlled along with the rest of the project code.	The project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
